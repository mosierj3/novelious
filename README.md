Novelius

Novelius is a project I started working on last year. The goal is to create a place for people who like writing to connect with other writers for ideas, feedback, and just to be a part of a community. For people who aren't really into writing, or maybe just need some inspiration, there is a "Reading" section where anyone can come and read all published stories from the contributers. The idea there, is that a reader could subscribe to a certain writer, and when the writer publishes a chapter to a story in development, all members subsribed to that writer would recieve a notification and be able to read the new chapter. In this way, a member could read any writers work (that chooses to publish) as they write it. Ideally, this provides motivation to keep writing, and for the readers, it provides stories in segments, similar to literary podcasts, or even television.
